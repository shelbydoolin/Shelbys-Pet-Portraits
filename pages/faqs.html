                    <div class="faq-question">What kind of photo do I need to provide?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>The best photos for portraits are well-lit, clear images that show your pet's face and expression. Front-facing photos typically work best as they capture your pet's unique personality. However, I can work with your favorite photos even if they aren't perfect. If you're unsure about your photo, feel free to send it over before ordering, and I'll let you know if it will work well for a portrait.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>From order placement to delivery, the process typically takes 4-6 weeks. This includes the initial consultation, sketch approval, painting time, final review, and shipping. Rush orders may be available for an additional fee, depending on my current workload.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Your satisfaction is my top priority! I send a photo of the finished portrait for your approval before shipping. If any adjustments are needed, I'm happy to make them to ensure you're completely satisfied. In the rare event that you're not happy with the final portrait, I offer a satisfaction guarantee and will work with you to make it right.</p>

                    <div class="faq-question">Can you include multiple pets in one portrait?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Absolutely! I can create portraits featuring multiple pets together. The price depends on the portrait size and the number of pets. For each additional pet, there is a 50% surcharge of the base price. Please note that for multi-pet portraits, I recommend selecting a larger size to ensure each pet's details can be captured properly.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>I use professional-grade acrylic paints on high-quality stretched canvas. Once complete, each portrait is sealed with a UV-protective varnish to prevent fading and ensure longevity. The painting comes ready to hang with hardware already installed.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes, many of my clients commission portraits as memorials for beloved pets who have passed. I understand how precious these memories are and approach these commissions with particular care and sensitivity. Even with older or lower-quality photos, I can often create a beautiful tribute to your companion. Please share any specific memories or personality traits that you'd like captured in the portrait.</p>

                        <p>During the initial consultation, we'll discuss your preferences and I'll provide recommendations based on your photo and vision. Each customization option adds a unique touch to make your portrait truly one-of-a-kind.</p>

                        <p>Yes! Pet portraits make wonderful gifts, and I offer beautifully designed digital or physical gift certificates. These can be purchased for specific sizes or as a custom amount toward a commission. The recipient can then contact me to begin the commission process when they're ready.</p>
